# BIOSTAT 625 Project Group 6
**Project Topic:** Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Patient Survival Outcomes

**Group Members:** Claire Kong, Leyuan Qian and Xiwen Feng

## Project Description

This study aims to apply different machine learning algorithms on real-world clinical data to predict patient survival outcome and help healthcare professionals optimize their patient management strategies.

## Data

The full dataset, training dataset and test dataset are in the [Data](/Data) folder.

## Code

The code for data processing and data spliting can be found in [data_processing.ipynb](/Codes/data_processing.ipynb) in the [Codes](/Codes) folder.

The codes for implementing the three machine learning methods are in the [Codes](/Codes) folder, named with the corresponding method.

## Report
The pdf file of the final report is [Final-Project-Group-6.pdf](/Final-Project-Group-6.pdf).

The Rmd file that generates the report is [Final Project Group 6.Rmd](/Final-Project-Group-6.Rmd).
